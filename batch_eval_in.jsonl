Is this used to increase self esteem? While making sure each person feels included, are we making the true achievers feel cheated? There will always be arguments for and against each, but the current system in place is one that recognizes as many exceptional participants as possible.  Students will have to compete for their first job, promotion, and anything else they want. The co-valedictorian system in place only equalizes the playing field in the academic area. No one suggests multiple homecoming queens or numerous people taking turns being the lead in the school play throughout the show. It is true that academics take precedence over the other fields in high school, but that makes it all the more relevant to award the single person that deserves the honor rather than diluting the meaning.'

By doing these small actions you would help save the endangered species of the Monarch Butterfly. How is Whitefish Bay helping?The local Whitefish Bay Garden club is a well-educated group of gardeners that helps Whitefish Bay stay green and beautiful.
