The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp (VST).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n     \n      Ahead of the\u00a0company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28, we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's (INTC) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,\u00a0GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0\"Magnificent Seven.\"\n \n      The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets, citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n     \n      As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n     \n      From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n     \n      Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n     \n      In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n     ',Is this post related to nvidia's stock or market behavior?

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n     \n      \u201cWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,\u201d Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they\u2019re physically inside\u201d the country, he added.\n     \n      While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang\u2019s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created \u201cGPU haves and GPU have nots.\u201d\n     \n      \u201cWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.\u201d\n     \n      Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a \u201cfailure\u201d and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n     \n      Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. \u201cChina has 50% of the world\u2019s AI developers, and it\u2019s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,\u201d he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n     \n      Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies\u2019 access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n     \n      \u201cThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,\u201d said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. \u201cMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.\u201d\n     ',Is this post related to nvidia's stock or market behavior?

One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a 5GW AI Campus, with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span 10 square miles.\n     \n      To put this into perspective, thats:\n     \n      50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n     \n      3.2 million Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n     \n      More power than NYC and San Francisco combined\n \n      Equivalent to powering 3-4 million homes or running 50 million gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n     \n      As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n     \n      First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n     \n      DCBBS stands for Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions, and it\u2019s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building full AI racks, not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form like this. In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in under a day.\n \n      Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n     \n      Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n     \n      1U and 2U server chassis\n     \n      Motherboards\n     \n      Power supplies\n     \n      GPU trays\n     \n      Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That\u2019s low-margin business, because you\u2019re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n     \n      CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n     \n      Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n     \n      Network switches\n     \n      Rack management software\n     \n      Power distribution units (PDUs)\n     \n      Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n     \n      Now lets go more in depth:\n     \n1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit\n \n      Traditional air-cooled servers sell for $10K\u2013$50K each.\n     \n      Liquid-cooled DCBBS racks (often 64\u201396 GPUs) sell for $2\u20135 million per rack.\n     \n      Even if gross margins stay in the 8\u201310% range, gross profit per rack is 40\u00d7\u201380\u00d7 higher than per-server sales.\n     \n      Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n     \n2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers\n \n      With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it\u2019s delivering:\n     \n      8\u201312 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n     \n      2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n     \n      Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n     \n      Power delivery + networking\n     \n      Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n     \n      Software/BIOS optimization\n     \n      All of these are designed, manufactured, and assembled in-house, which means:\n     \n      Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n     \n      Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n     \n      Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n     \n3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power\n \n      SMCI can ship fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3\u20134 weeks, while others take 8\u201312 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n     \n      For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this speed translates into willingness to pay more, or at least not negotiate down.\n     \n      For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n     \n      Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n     \n      3\u20134 month delay in deploying AI training models\n     \n      Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n     \n      Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n     \n      This \u201ctime-value\u201d premium enhances margin per contract.\n     \n4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients\n \n      Clients benefit from:\n     \n      30\u201350%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n     \n      Higher rack density \u2192 fewer racks \u2192 less real estate\n     \n      Reduced HVAC burden \u2192 capex + opex savings\n     \n      Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80\u2013100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack \u2014 which:\n     \n      Makes SMCI\u2019s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n     \n      Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n     \n      Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n     \n5. Operational Efficiency at Scale\n \n      SMCI is building out:\n     \n      A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n     \n      A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n     \n      This allows SMCI to:\n     \n      Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n     \n      Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n     \n      Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n     \n      Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit \u2192 rising margin\n     \n      Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n     \n      So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n     \n      Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n     \n      After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming each rack draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n     \n      As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n     \nHow ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods\n \n      This wasn\u2019t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n     \n1. Historical Precedent (30%)\n \n      No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n     \n      Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build \u2014 suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n     \n2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)\n \n      Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) split procurement across 2\u20134 OEMs for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n     \n      Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators, etc.\n     \n3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)\n \n      SMCI can output ~5,000 racks/month total, 2,000+ liquid cooled.\n     \n      To hit 50\u2013100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they\u2019d need to commit 6\u201312 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n     \n4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)\n \n      SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10\u201325% is well within reach.\n     \n      But 50\u2013100% would likely require exclusive national alignment, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n     \n5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)\n \n      SMCI\u2019s lead time (3\u20134 weeks vs. 8\u201312 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n     \n      For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could justify awarding 25% or more \u2014 but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n     \n      I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n     \nAccount Sales Manager\n \nTechnology Enablement Engineer\n \n      All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n     \n      Last but not least, Cramer is \u201cSick of\u201d SMCI\n     \n      TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n     \n      Position: 15 $91c 1/16 https://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n ',Is this post related to nvidia's stock or market behavior?

They\u2019ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals.

The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.\n     \n      2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos\n     \n      Strategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock\u2019s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius\u2019 AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential\n     \n      3. Infrastructure Expansion\n     \n      Nebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity.

That is around four times more than it would have been allowed to buy under a Biden-era chip export control framework, known as AI diffusion, it said.\n     \n      Trump's administration plans to rescind and modify this rule, which curbed the export of sophisticated AI chips, a spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce had said last week.\n     ',Is this post related to nvidia's stock or market behavior?
