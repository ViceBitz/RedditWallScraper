       NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence
    ","
      Nvidia (NVDA) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) since the launch of ChatGPT in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp (VST).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as a cornerstone of the recent bull market in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.
     
      Ahead of the company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28, we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's (INTC) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — formed what would come to be known as the ""Magnificent Seven.""
 
      The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024, three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets, citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.
     
      As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.
     
      From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.
     
      Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.
     
      In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

      What Happened?
     
      Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 36.3% in the afternoon session after renewed enthusiasm for quantum computing following the sharp pullback in the first quarter of the year.
     
      While specific news for the day wasn't immediately apparent to have caused a major surge, the company has had a series of positive announcements, including strong Q1 2025 earnings that beat analyst estimates.
     
      Earlier in the week, the company announced a collaboration with Swedish company Einride to develop quantum solutions for fleet routing, logistics optimization, and supply chain solutions. This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.
     
      Adding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.
     
      The shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.

      What The Market Is Telling Us
     
      IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
     
      The previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as ""unsustainable,"" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers ""was possible."" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.
     
      IonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.
     
      Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

      (Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.
     
      “We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.
     
      While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”
     
      “When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”
     
      Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.
     
      Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.
     
      Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.
     
      “These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”

       What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI
    ","
      This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a $20 billion deal with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a 5GW AI Campus, with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span 10 square miles.
     
      To put this into perspective, thats:
     
      50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
     
      3.2 million Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
     
      More power than NYC and San Francisco combined
 
      Equivalent to powering 3-4 million homes or running 50 million gaming PCs at full power 24/7
     
      As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?
     
      First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.
     
      DCBBS stands for Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building full AI racks, not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form like this. In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in under a day.
 
      Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.
     
      Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:
     
      1U and 2U server chassis
     
      Motherboards
     
      Power supplies
     
      GPU trays
     
      Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:
     
      CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
     
      Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
     
      Network switches
     
      Rack management software
     
      Power distribution units (PDUs)
     
      Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:
     
      Now lets go more in depth:
     
1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit
 
      Traditional air-cooled servers sell for $10K–$50K each.
     
      Liquid-cooled DCBBS racks (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for $2–5 million per rack.
     
      Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher than per-server sales.
     
      Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.
     
2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers
 
      With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:
     
      8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
     
      2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
     
      Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
     
      Power delivery + networking
     
      Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
     
      Software/BIOS optimization
     
      All of these are designed, manufactured, and assembled in-house, which means:
     
      Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
     
      Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
     
      Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles
     
3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power
 
      SMCI can ship fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.
     
      For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this speed translates into willingness to pay more, or at least not negotiate down.
     
      For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:
     
      Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
     
      3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
     
      Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers
     
      Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:
     
      This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.
     
4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients
 
      Clients benefit from:
     
      30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
     
      Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
     
      Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings
     
      Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:
     
      Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
     
      Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive
     
      Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin
     
5. Operational Efficiency at Scale
 
      SMCI is building out:
     
      A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
     
      A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly
     
      This allows SMCI to:
     
      Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
     
      Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
     
      Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity
     
      Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin
     
      Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:
     
      So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.
     
      Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal
     
      After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming each rack draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:
     
      As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.
     
How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods
 
      This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:
     
1. Historical Precedent (30%)
 
      No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
     
      Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.
     
2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)
 
      Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) split procurement across 2–4 OEMs for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
     
      Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators, etc.
     
3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)
 
      SMCI can output ~5,000 racks/month total, 2,000+ liquid cooled.
     
      To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.
     
4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)
 
      SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
     
      But 50–100% would likely require exclusive national alignment, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.
     
5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)
 
      SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
     
      For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could justify awarding 25% or more — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.
     
      I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:
     
Account Sales Manager
 
Technology Enablement Engineer
 
      All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.
     
      Last but not least, Cramer is “Sick of” SMCI
     
      TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

       Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know
    ","
      Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.
     
      Huang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.
     
      Shares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.
     
      At last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.
     
      ""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.
     
      Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

      To be honest with the Moody news it may look bearish but hopefully with Computex 2025 taking place starting Sunday going into next week with Jensen as the keynote speaker providing guidance and providing more information it can offset the news.

      NBIS remain undervalued.
     
      Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:
     
      Strong Revenue Growth:
     
      Nebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.
     
      2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos
     
      Strategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock’s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius’ AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential
     
      3. Infrastructure Expansion
     
      Nebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI
     
      4. AI-Centric Platform
     
      Nebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge
     
      5. Analyst Optimism
     
      Analysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.
     
      6. Financial Position
     
      With nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.
     
      7. Diverse Portfolio
     
      Beyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.
     
      8. Clickhouse 28% ownership
     
      valuation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$
     
      9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.

       US Weighs Letting UAE Buy Over a Million Advanced Nvidia Chips, Bloomberg News Reports

      (Reuters) - The Trump administration is weighing a deal that would allow the UAE to import more than a million advanced Nvidia chips, a quantity that far exceeds limits under Biden-era AI chip regulations, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.
     
      The deal, which is still being negotiated and could change, would let the UAE import 500,000 of the most advanced chips on the market each year from now to 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
     
      While one-fifth would be set aside for the Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, the rest will go to U.S. companies building data centers in the Gulf nation, according to the report.
     
      ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which may announce new data-center capacity in the UAE as soon as this week, could be one of those companies, the report said.
     
      The report comes on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump securing a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the United States.
     
      The Department of Commerce and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.
     
      Abu Dhabi's artificial intelligence push has mostly been led by state-backed G42, which has drawn increased scrutiny from China hawks in Washington amid fears that the UAE is becoming a conduit for China to receive advanced American AI technology it is blocked from getting directly from the U.S.
     
      According to the Bloomberg report, G42 could purchase computing capabilities equivalent to between 1 million and 1.5 million H100 chips over the lifetime of the deal. That is around four times more than it would have been allowed to buy under a Biden-era chip export control framework, known as AI diffusion, it said.
     
      Trump's administration plans to rescind and modify this rule, which curbed the export of sophisticated AI chips, a spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce had said last week.
